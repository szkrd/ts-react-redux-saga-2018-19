I've spent more than a year on a medium sized project (192 components as of this writing) with typescript, react, redux and sagas - I've used Vue and both new and old Angular before, but the react-redux combo was something new and I was eager to see it in action.

These are my thoughts and notes on the topic, what worked and what didn't, what was useful and what was a dead end.

1. [Typescript](./typescript)
2. [React](./react)
3. [Redux](./redux)
4. [Saga](./saga)
5. [Xmlhttp](./xmlhttp)
6. [Debugging](./debugging)
