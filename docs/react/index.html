<h2><a name="1">Prop drilling</a></h2>
<p>My greatest problem with the project I started working with was <em>&quot;prop drilling&quot;</em> (letting props propagate down to their destination through a series of unrelated components). The layout was fairly conservative: top level components get their props from the store (through connect) and they pass down what&#39;s needed to where it&#39;s needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>props sometimes travelled as deep as 5-6 levels</li>
<li>most of the time whole state objects were passed down<ul>
<li>state objects (<code>this.props.state</code>) and <code>this.state</code> were terribly confusing</li>
<li>while these objects are comfortable with their clearly defined interfaces
it was pretty hard to see the input and the output of components</li>
<li>tracking down event dispatches (via callbacks) and props were a real pain </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It was perfectly clear that prop drilling is painful and encapsulated prop packages are a pain.</p>
<h2><a name="2">Presentational and container components?</a></h2>
<p>The react community fairly early on realized that something needs to be done. <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0">Abramov&#39;s article</a> tried to elaborate on the dumb and connected component ideas.</p>
<p>Since our connectors happened to be (conservatively enough) on the topmost levels (apart from a small minority of components) it was rather easy to split them into containers and components.</p>
<ol>
<li>this made the project much easier to navigate</li>
<li>using &quot;connect&quot; (especially with ownProps) with typescript is a real pain:
the amount of code a connector requires is truly terrifying</li>
<li>splitting the project to containers and components seemed at times rather &quot;unintuitive&quot;
and refactoring a component to a container or vice versa became rather dreadful.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="3">Composition and context?</a></h2>
<p>Context ended up something rather cumbersome - even a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#when-to-use-context">single value</a> context felt out of place: we had a way of avoiding prop drilling, yet it was so uncomfortable, that using it for more than a single property was out of the question.</p>
<p>The react documentation proposes <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html">composition</a> for these scenarios, but trying to compose components deeper than a single level is a real mess (messy cart before a sad horse). </p>
<h2><a name="4">Hybrid approach to avoid prop drilling</a></h2>
<p>In the end what helped (somewhat) was a mixed approach with a bit of a laissez faires attitude:</p>
<ol>
<li>I simplified the <code>connect</code> process with a connect helper (see the <a href="../redux/index.html">redux</a> section)</li>
<li>I Created a simple <code>dispatcher</code> and <code>subscriber</code> hook through a single channel dedicated event bus
(now possible with Redux <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/next/api/hooks">since version 7.1</a>)</li>
<li>Allowed ad-hoc connections:<ul>
<li>no more container vs component distinction</li>
<li>if a connection is complicated it may go next to the original component: <em>Foo.tsx</em> and <em>ConnectedFoo.tsx</em></li>
<li>simple connections may be done at the end of a file: <code>export default Foo</code>, <code>export const ConnectedFoo = ...</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="5">Component hierarchy</a></h2>
<p>With mixing components and containers we followed these rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>reusable/dumb/presentational (and effectively <em>reused</em>) components should go the top of the component directory</li>
<li>non reusable components (connected or using subscribe/dispatch) should be under their parent component&#39;s folder</li>
<li>logical grouping components into subfolders is rare, but allowed (for example the &quot;buy product&quot; flow contained 5
&quot;pages&quot;, so they ended up under <em>buyProduct</em>)</li>
<li>follow the <em>foo.scss</em> + <em>Foo.tsx</em> naming convention</li>
<li>if a component has a top level element then it should have a dash cased class name: <em>FooBarPage.tsx</em> = <code>foo-bar-page</code></li>
<li>connectors may happen inside the end of a file or in another file (<em>ConnectedFoo.tsx</em>)</li>
<li>connectors should avoid using ownProps (unfortunately this is kinda hard to do nicely)</li>
<li>connectors may prep props freely and if they feel necessary, they can return null (avoid rendering the encapsulated component) - yes, if a component doesn&#39;t exist, then it should not be &quot;alive&quot; (even if it is a connector), but sometimes this really made life easier</li>
<li>avoid anon functions (even with the connector HOC)</li>
<li>top level routed item must end with the <em>Page</em> suffix, an app level modal should end with the <em>Modal</em> suffix</li>
<li>do try to use unique component names to help navigating inside the code (do NOT abbreviate, if a component name is long, then so be it)</li>
<li>components must always be inside their folder on the top level, below that they may be next to their parent </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="6">Higher order components (HOCs)</a></h2>
<p>I don&#39;t really like HOCs: I find them unintuitive and in the react debugger they really mess up the component hierarchy.</p>
<p>They seemed to be an early silver bullet for code reuse and composition, but I find them superseded by the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hook system</a> and I try to avoid them if possible.</p>

<h2><a name="11">Hooks</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>react hooks are a godsend in terms of code reusability</li>
<li><code>componentDidMount</code> can <em>roughly</em> be translated to <code>useEffect(fn, [])</code> (the empty array is the dependency list)</li>
<li>I find components with more than 3 or 4 variables hard to grok and brittle</li>
<li>classes became <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#classes-confuse-both-people-and-machines">second class citizens</a> in the react world and I&#39;m not sure if I like this (on the other hand ui components with class based inheritance is a huge no-no)</li>
<li>react component lifecycle did not support a mixin system (like <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html">Vue did</a>), hooks do help tremendously</li>
<li>as a rule of thumb I <strong>avoid</strong> rewriting classes that have &quot;exotic&quot; lifecycle trickery or a complicated internal state - componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount and event callbacks are fine</li>
