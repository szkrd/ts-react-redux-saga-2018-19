# React, redux, saga, typescript notes

Also available at: https://szkrd.github.io/ts-react-redux-saga-2018-19/

I've spent more than a year on a medium sized (100+ components) project with the above stack - I've used Vue and both new and old Angular for quite some time, but the react-redux combo was something new and I was eager to see it in action.

These are my thoughts and notes on the topic, what worked and what didn't, what was useful and what was a dead end.

Feel free to browse the repository, or access a [rudimentary render](https://szkrd.github.io/ts-react-redux-saga-2018-19/) via github.
